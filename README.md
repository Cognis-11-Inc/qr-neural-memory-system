# QR Neural Memory System

An experimental, Rust-first investigation of a mutable, QR-inspired computational matrix.

We investigate what the substrate's rules actually permit. Useful memory behavior and any unexpected computation must be measured, reproduced, and explained before they become claims.

## Initial direction

- **4,096 computational cells** arranged in a **64 × 64 mutable binary matrix**.
- Approximately **80% Rust / 20% Python**, a flexible architectural target. Rust owns the engine and deterministic experiments; Python supports analysis, statistics, plots, and comparisons.
- CPU execution and deterministic experiments first.
- Distributed representations, local interactions, and experimentally defined plasticity.
- No conventional QR error correction or conventional neural-network architecture imposed at the start.
- Persistence and deterministic replay as research requirements for the engine.

“QR-inspired” describes the matrix concept; these cells are computational units, not individual QR-code images. Compatibility with standard QR codes is not an initial objective.

## Experiment 001: first measurable memory behavior

1. Teach the substrate associations using an explicit, documented update rule.
2. Attempt reconstruction from incomplete cues.
3. Measure whether learning new associations damages older ones.
4. Compare results against controls and record the initial state, parameters, input sequence, and results needed to reproduce them.

A further research question is whether retrieving a memory can change the substrate and alter subsequent propagation. This remains a hypothesis to test, as does computation beyond associative retrieval.

## Status

The foundation provides a 4,096-cell binary state representation and a Python reconstruction-error metric. Learning, propagation, retrieval, persistence, and Experiment 001 are not implemented yet. No memory-performance or emergence claim has been demonstrated.

## Development checks

Rust is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Python requires 3.12 or newer; hosted CI checks 3.12 and 3.14. Create an isolated Python environment and install the pinned development tools:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Run the same checks used by severe CI:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --locked --doc --all-features
cargo build --locked --release --all-targets --all-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --locked --no-deps --all-features
.venv/bin/python -m ruff format --check .
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
.venv/bin/python -W error -m unittest discover -s analysis -t . -v
.venv/bin/python -W error -m compileall -q analysis
```

CI additionally sets `RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings'`. Workflow: [Severe CI](https://github.com/Cognis-11-Inc/qr-neural-memory-system/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
